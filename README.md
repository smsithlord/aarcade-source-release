# Early Access
AArcade: Source is still in Early Access & actively being developed.  Thank you for considering contributingg to this project!  Please join the AArcade community in the Discord w/ the invite in the ```Join AArcade Community Discord``` section!

This repo contains the same files as the current release version of AArcade: Source on Steam.

(However, this repo ONLY contains the ```frontend``` folder.  You'll have to get the rest of the destribution from Steam.)

These files are **for developer use** - in conjunction with the ```aarcade-source-client``` repo.  (Developers often need an extra copy of the vanilla version of the game files to test new stuff on.)

If you want to PLAY Anarchy Arcade, you should get it from the [Anarchy Arcade Steam Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/266430/Anarchy_Arcade/).
